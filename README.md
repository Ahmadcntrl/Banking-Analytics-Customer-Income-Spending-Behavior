# Banking Analytics: Customer Income & Spending Behavior
- Project Goal: To identify high-potential customer segments for credit card product launches and market expansion strategies.

## 🔍 Executive Summary
This analysis covers a customer base of 4,000 active users with a total spending footprint of Rs 531M. The data reveals a high-performing "Power Segment": Married Salaried IT Professionals (Age 25-45) who exhibit a high expense ratio (43%) and a preference for digital spending. A significant 60% of current spending occurs through non-credit channels, representing a massive market conversion opportunity.

## 📈 Key Data Insights
### 1. The "Power User" Profile
- Demographic Dominance: 74% of all spending is driven by the 25-45 age group.

- Marital Status: Married individuals make up 79% of the customer base, indicating higher financial stability and recurring household needs.

- Professional Leaders: Salaried IT Employees lead in total volume (Rs 244M), while Business Owners command the highest average monthly income.

### 2. Geographic & Seasonal "Sweet Spots"
- Top City: Hyderabad is the primary growth engine with Rs 172M in total spending.

- Seasonality: A sharp upward trend is visible from July to September, peaking at Rs 116M in September, likely driven by seasonal shopping or back-to-school cycles.

- Expense Efficiency: The average Expense Ratio is 43%, but this climbs to 51% in Hyderabad, suggesting a higher reliance on credit/banking services in that region.

### 3. Untapped Market Potential
- Channel Migration: Rs 216M is spent via Credit Cards, but a combined Rs 315M still flows through Net Banking, Debit Cards, and RAAST.

- Gender Gap: Female customers represent only 36% of the base despite showing consistent income levels, marking a significant underserved segment.

### 💡 Strategic Recommendations
🎯 Targeted Product Launch
- The "IT-Professional" Card: Launch a credit product specifically for IT employees in Hyderabad featuring high rewards for Bill Payments (the largest spend category at Rs 105M).

- Timing: Kick off marketing campaigns in June to capture the massive spending surge that begins in July.

### 🛠 Conversion Strategy
- Incentivize "RAAST" Users: Offer "first-time-user" rewards to transition the Rs 141M RAAST/Net-Banking volume into the credit card ecosystem.

- Business Credit Lines: Develop flexible credit limits for Business Owners, who show high income but are currently under-represented in total spending volume compared to salaried peers.

### 🚀 Expansion & Retention
- Female-Focused Financial Products: Bridge the 36% gender gap with products tailored for female professionals, focusing on "Stable Income/High Reliability" branding.

- Regional Tiering: Focus Phase 1 on Hyderabad, followed by a Phase 2 rollout in Karachi and Lahore, which show the next highest spending volumes.
